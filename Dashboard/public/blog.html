            Introduction: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of
            interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines,
            objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers
            and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring
            human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
